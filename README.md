# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Welcome to the Emotion Identification using CREMA-D dataset repository! This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to identify emotions in speech and text data.

## CREMA-D 

The [CREMA-D](https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D) dataset is a large collection of audio and text data annotated with emotion labels. It includes a wide range of emotions, including happiness, anger, sadness, and fear, among others. This dataset is particularly useful for emotion identification because it includes a diverse range of emotions and is annotated by multiple annotators to ensure high quality labeling.
